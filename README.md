# Fake-Youtube-views-Generator

This is my Third Project, it took me 26 days, 20 min a day. It is very simple what it does. I ran out of ideas so i made this one.
This is a Desktop application made with tkinter python and also used selenium for browser automating.

You specify a youtube video, it refreshes the site and that will make fake youtube views. You can specify how long should he wait after
every refresh. And it also counts how many refreshes it did while it is active.

There is not much to say. If you want to try it,feel free to download it and you need to have python installed to run this.
Libraries you need to install in python are specified in a text file.
